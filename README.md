This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Environment Variables

This app uses the Unsplash API and requires an access key.

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the project root (same level as `package.json`).
2. Add your Unsplash Access Key (client-side safe) as follows:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=your_unsplash_access_key_here
```

- You can obtain an Access Key from the Unsplash Developer portal.
- After changing environment variables, restart the dev server (`Ctrl + C` then `npm run dev`).

### Troubleshooting

- 401 or empty results: verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY` is present and valid.
- If images donâ€™t load due to network rules, allow requests to `https://api.unsplash.com`.
